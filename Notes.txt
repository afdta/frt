Chord diagram may not be the right fit in this case:
1. Data don't represent a complete system. Foreign markets don't trade with each other in the data, nor
   do domestic markets.
2. If we're just talking about viewing data for a single metro area, then why not just do bar charts?
3. This still may be valuable if we opt to indicate directed relationships, e.g. exports and imports on same diagram.


Chord diagram basics
1. Rows in the matrix represent groups. The groups provide source data. Groups have index values.
2. Subindex values indicate the column within a row or group.
3. The (i,j) value represents the source value that flows with the (j,i) target value. (Think matrix transposition.)
4. Relationships can be directed. The source value might be 10 while the target value might be 100. 
   (e.g. country A might export 10 units to country B, but country B might export 100 units to country A).

Exceptions to above "basics":
To determine the source and target objects for a chord, D3 examines all cells in the upper triangle of the (square) matrix and compares
them to corresponding cells in the lower triangle. If the value of [i,j] is less than [j,i] then [j,i] is considered the source value. Otherwise [i,j] is the source and [j,i] the target. Also note that because only the upper triangle is looped through to create chords, if [i,j]==[j,i] then [i,j] will always be the source. It makes sense to only examine the upper triangle because there is no reason to compare values twice (e.g. [i,j]==[j,i] then [j,i]==[i,j]) to determine source and target nodes.

Other thoughts
Sankey diagram? Might be useful to view a given market's commodities -> mode -> market. Or just commodities -> market in this case.
