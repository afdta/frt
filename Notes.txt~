Chord diagram may not be the right fit in this case:
1. Data don't represent a complete system


Chord diagram basics
1. Rows in the matrix represent groups. The groups provide source data. Groups have index values.
2. Subindex values indicate the column within a row (group).
3. The (i,j) value represents the source value that flows with the (j,i) target value. (Think matrix transposition.)
4. Relationships can be directed. The source value might be 10 while the target value might be 100. 
   (e.g. country A might export 10 units to country B, but country B might export 100 units to country A).
